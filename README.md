We need to calculate the dot product of two vectors, We shiuld Use NumPy’s dot, The dot product of two vectors, a and b, is defined as, where ai ,  is the ith element of vector a and bi, 
is the ith element of vector b. We can use NumPy’s dot function to calculate the dot product. Alternatively, in Python 3.5+ we can use the new @ operator.
